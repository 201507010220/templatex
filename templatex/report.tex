\begin{abstract}
    With the development of deep learning, more and more applications use the knowledge of deep learning to solve practical problems. This paper discusses how to use depth to solve the problem of box office forecast. With the improvement of living standards, people have more time to improve their quality of life, such as watching movies. In the first half of 2017, China's film market showed new characteristics and trends. Under the dual promotion of policy guidance and market regulation, the development of the domestic film industry will enter the development stage driven by key high-quality content. As of June 30, 2017, the total box office revenue of Chinese mainland films was 27.177 billion yuan, with a year-on-year growth of 10.51. Therefore, it is necessary for the film industry to predict how much profit it may make if it makes a film. In this paper, deep learning neural network is used to predict the income of a movie.\\
